# Portfolio
Hello, here you can find my portfolio projects that will allow to reveal my skills in a practical way:
1. **k-nrm**
This project is a web service to find similar questions based on Flask. At the input a list of questions is submitted and for each of the questions the top 100 candidates from the index faiss are displayed, then knrm ranks them and gives top k of the most relevant candidates. [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) vectors will be used as text embeddings
