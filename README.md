# Portfolio
Hi there, here you can find my portfolio projects that will allow to reveal my skills in a practical way:
1. [**k-nrm**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06613.pdf)

This project is a micro web service to find similar questions based on Flask. At the input a list of questions is submitted and for each of the questions the top 100 candidates from the faiss index are displayed, then knrm ranks them and gives top k of the most relevant candidates. [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) vectors will be used as text embeddings. The popular [Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset](https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks) was used for training knrn.
